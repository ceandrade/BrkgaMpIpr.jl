    "text": "BrkgaMpIpr.jl provides a very easy-to-use framework for the Multi-Parent Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with Implict Path Relink (BRKGA-MP-IPR). Assuming that your have a decoder to your problem, we can setup, run, and extract the value of the best solution in less than 5 commands (obvisiously, you may need few other lines fo code to do a proper test).This Julia version provides a framework as fast as C/C++, as easy-to-code as Python, and it is much cheaper (indeed, free) than Matlab. Unit and coverage tests are fully implemented, and all pseudo-random test data were carefully crafted to guarantee reproducibility (although it is possible that some tests fail because of different versions of the random number generator). Therefore, BrkgaMpIpr.jl should be suitable to be used in production environments.If you are like me and also like C++, check out the C++ version. At this moment, we have no plans to implement the BRKGA-MP-IPR in other languages such as Python, Java, or C#. But if you want to do so, you are must welcome. But please, keep the API as close as possible to the C++ API (or Julia API in case you decide go C), and use the best coding and documentation practices of your chosen language/framework.If you are not familiar with how BRKGA works, take a look on Standard BRKGA and Multi-Parent BRKGA. In the future, we will provide a Prime on BRKGA-MP section. If you know what elite set, decoder, and so means, we can get to the guts on the Guide / Tutorial.Pages = [\"guide.md\", \"api.md\", \"contributing.md\"]"

We will use parts of that code in this guide. There, we solve the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. Given a set of cities and the distances between them (full weighted undirect graph), one must find a minimum-cost tour among all cities, such that each city is visited only once (i.e., find a Hamiltonian cycle of minimum cost).

This code allows fine-grained control of the optimization, show several features of BRKGA-MP-IPR such as the path-reliking calls, resets, chromosome injection, and others. It also logs all optimization steps, creating outputs easy to be parsed.

    "text": "All problem information must be encapsulated in a struct inherited from AbstractInstance. AbstractInstance is an empty-abstract struct required in the signature of the decoder function (described further). For example, assume we want to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. One possible instance struct could be:struct TSP_Instance <: AbstractInstance\n    num_nodes::Int64\n    distances::Array{Float64}\nendSo, note that we have the number of nodes/citiesnum_nodes, and the distance matrix distances. We may need some additional code to load the instance and to deal with the distance matrix (omitted here, see tsp_instance.jl).The second and most important requirement is the decoder function. The mandatory signature of the decoder isdecode!(chromosome::Array{Float64, 1},\n        problem_instance::AbstractInstance,\n        rewrite::Bool = true)::Float64chromosome is a vector of numbers in the interval [0, 1] to be decoded. problem_instance is the data structure containing information about the problem. Such data is used by the decoder to build a solution. rewrite is an optional argument that indicates if the decoder should rewrite the chromosome, in case of local search / local improvements be performed during the decoder process. This flag is critical if you intend to use the Implicit Path Relink (details on path_relink!). The decoder must return a Float64 that is used as the fitness to rank the chromosomes. In general, fitness is the cost/value of the solution, but you may want to use it to penalize solutions that violate the problem constraints, for example.In our TSP example, we have a very simple decoder that generates a permutation of nodes, and compute the cost of the cycle from that permutation (note the used of function distance that returns the distance between two nodes and it is defined on tsp_instance.jl).function tsp_decode!(chromosome::Array{Float64}, instance::TSP_Instance,\n                     rewrite::Bool = true)::Float64\n\n    permutation = Array{Tuple{Float64, Int64}}(undef, instance.num_nodes)\n    for (index, key) in enumerate(chromosome)\n        permutation[index] = (key, index)\n    end\n\n    sort!(permutation)\n\n    cost = distance(instance, permutation[1][2], permutation[end][2])\n    for i in 1:(instance.num_nodes - 1)\n        cost += distance(instance, permutation[i][2], permutation[i + 1][2])\n    end\n\n    return cost\nendWith the instance data and the decoder ready, we can build the BRKGA data structures and perform the optimization."

    "category": "section",
    "text": "BrkgaMpIpr framework revolves over a single data structure called BrkgaData that represents the internal state of the BRKGA-MP-IPR algorithm. Since this structure has no constructor, you must build it using one of the Building functions. There are two build_brkga methods:load the parameters from a file:function build_brkga(\n    problem_instance::AbstractInstance,\n    decode_function!::Function,\n    opt_sense::Sense,\n    seed::Int64,\n    chromosome_size::Int64,\n    configuration_file::String,\n    evolutionary_mechanism_on::Bool = true\n)::Tuple{BrkgaData, ExternalControlParams}load the parameters from a hand-made parameter object:function build_brkga(\n    problem_instance::AbstractInstance,\n    decode_function!::Function,\n    opt_sense::Sense,\n    seed::Int64,\n    chromosome_size::Int64,\n    brkga_params::BrkgaParams,\n    evolutionary_mechanism_on::Bool = true,\n)::BrkgaDataBoth methods require a problem_instance to be used in the decode_function! as commented before.note: Note\nTo date, there is not an easy and clean way to force a function type, as we can do in C and C++, and then, decode_function! is declared as a simple, high-level Function type. However, decode_function! must have the expected signature as explained before.You also must indicate whether you are minimizing or maximizing through optimization Sense.A good seed also must be provided for the (pseudo) random number generator (according to this paper). BrkgaMpIpr uses the Mersenne Twister [1] [2].The chromosome_size also must be given. It indicates the length of each chromosome in the population. In general, this size depends on the instance and how the decoder works.Another common argument is evolutionary_mechanism_on which is enabled by default. When disabled, no evolution is performed. The algorithm only decodes the chromosomes and ranks them. On each generation, all population is replaced excluding the best chromosome. This flag helps on implementations of simple multi-start algorithms.As said before, the difference between the two methods is from where the algorithm\'s hyper-parameters come from. In the first version, the algorithm reads the BRKGA, IPR, and extra parameters from a simple text file that looks like this (see config.conf for detailed example):population_size 2000\nelite_percentage 0.30\nmutants_percentage 0.15\nnum_elite_parents 2\ntotal_parents 3\nbias_type LOGINVERSE\nnum_independent_populations 3\npr_number_pairs 0\npr_minimum_distance 0.15\npr_type PERMUTATION\npr_selection BESTSOLUTION\nalpha_block_size 1.0\npr_percentage 1.0\nexchange_interval 200\nnum_exchange_indivuduals 2\nreset_interval 600When reading such file, the algorithm ignores all blank lines, and lines starting with #. During the building process, the building method creates a BrkgaParams object and a ExternalControlParams object. BrkgaParams contains all hyper-parameters regarding BRKGA and IPR methods and is stored in the brand-new BrkgaData returned by the method. ExternalControlParams are parameters that can be used outside the BRKGA-MP-IPR to control several aspects of the optimization. For instance, interval to apply path relink, reset the population, perform population migration, among others. Although their presence is required on the config file, they are not mandatory to the BRKGA-MP-IPR itself.In the second method, we assume we already have a BrkgaParams object, and we just pass it directly to the function. Note that such param data is deep-copied inside BrkgaData.Let\'s take a look in the example from main_minimal.jl:seed = parse(Int64, ARGS[1])\nconfiguration_file = ARGS[2]\nnum_generations = parse(Int64, ARGS[3])\ninstance_file = ARGS[4]\n\ninstance = TSP_Instance(instance_file)\n\nbrkga_data, control_params = build_brkga(\n    instance, tsp_decode!, MINIMIZE, seed, instance.num_nodes,\n    configuration_file\n)This code gets some arguments from the command line and loads a TSP instance. After that, it builds brkga_data. Note that we pass the instance data and the tsp_decode! function. Since we are looking for cycles of minimum cost, we ask for the algorithm MINIMIZE. The starting seed is also given. Since tsp_decode! considers each chromosome key as a node/city, the length of the chromosome must be the number of nodes, i.e., instance.num_nodes. Finally, we also pass the configuration file.Let\'s take a look in a more elaborated example (main_complete.jl):brkga_params, control_params = load_configuration(configuration_file)\n...\nbrkga_params.population_size = min(brkga_params.population_size,\n                                   10 * instance.num_nodes)\n...\nbrkga_data = build_brkga(instance, tsp_decode!, MINIMIZE, seed,\n                         instance.num_nodes, brkga_params, perform_evolution)Here, we first load the configuration file using the helper function load_configuration. Then, we modify the population size to be the minimum between the original parameter and 10x the number of nodes (making the population size proportional to the instance size is a very common strategy used in genetic algorithms). Then, we call build_brkga using the param data instead of the configuration file (there is an additional parameter perform_evolution to tune the evolution either on or off, not necessary at this moment).Now, we have a BrkgaData which will be used in all other functions during the optimization. Note that we can build several BrkgaData objects using different parameters, decoders, or instance data. These structures can be evolved in parallel and mixed-and-matched at your will. Each one holds a self-contained BRKGA state including populations, fitness information, and a state of the random number generator."

Since BRKGA-MP-IPR does not know the problem structure, you must encode the warm-start solution as chromosomes (vectors in the interval [0, 1]). In other words, you must do the inverse process that decode! does. For instance, this is a piece of code from main_complete.jl showing this process:initial_cost, initial_tour = greedy_tour(instance)\n...\nkeys = sort(rand(instance.num_nodes))\ninitial_chromosome = zeros(instance.num_nodes)\nfor i in 1:instance.num_nodes\n    initial_chromosome[initial_tour[i]] = keys[i]\nend\n...\nset_initial_population!(brkga_data, [initial_chromosome])\ninitialize!(brkga_data)Here, we create one incumbent solution using the greedy heuristic greedy_tour() found in greedy_tour.jl. It gives us initial_tour which is a sequence of nodes to be visited. In the next four lines, we encode initial_tour. First, we create a vector of sorted random keys. Note that this is the same order that tsp_decode! uses. We then create the initial_chromosome, and fill it up with keys according to the nodes\' order in initial_tour. Finally, we use set_initial_population! to assign the incumbent to the initial population. Note that initial_chromosome in between braces because set_initial_population! takes a vector of chromosomes. See its signature:set_initial_population!(brkga_data::BrkgaData,\n                        chromosomes::Array{Array{Float64, 1}, 1})Indeed, you can have as much warm-start solutions as you like, limited to the size of the population.

You can use the companion functions:get_best_fitness(brkga_data::BrkgaData)::Float64get_best_chromosome(brkga_data::BrkgaData)::Array{Float64, 1}get_best_fitness returns the value/fitness of the best chromosome across all populations.get_best_chromosome returns a copy of the best chromosome across all populations.

If you do not provide the fitness, inject_chromosome! will decode the injected chromosome. For example, the following code injects a random chromosome keys into the population #1 in the last position (population_size), i.e., it will replace the worst solution:keys = sort(rand(instance.num_nodes))\ninject_chromosome!(brkga_data, keys, 1, brkga_data.params.population_size)"

This is the main signature of path_relink!path_relink!(brkga_data::BrkgaData,\n             pr_type::PathRelinkingType,\n             pr_selection::PathRelinkingSelection,\n             compute_distance::Function,\n             affect_solution::Function,\n             number_pairs::Int64,\n             minimum_distance::Float64,\n             block_size::Int64 = 1,\n             max_time::Float64 = 0.0,\n             percentage::Float64 = 1.0\n)::PathRelinkingResultThe first argument is the BrkgaData as usual. The 2nd argument defines the type of implicit path relink to be performed (PathRelinkingType). The DIRECT path relink exchanges the keys of two chromosomes directly, and it is usually more suitable to or threshold representations, i.e., where the key values are used to some kind of discretization, such as \" if x < 0.5, then 0, otherwise 1.\" The PERMUTATION path relink switches the order of a key according to its position in the other chromosome. Usually, this kind of path relink is more suitable to permutation representations, where the chromosome induces an order or permutation. For example, chromosome [0.4, 0.7, 0.1] may induce the increasing order (3, 1, 2). More details about threshold and permutation representations in this paper.PathRelinkingSelection defines how the algorithm picks the chromosomes for relinking. BESTSOLUTION selects, in the order, the best solution of each population. RANDOMELITE chooses uniformly random solutions from the elite sets.The next argument is a function to compute the distance between two chromosomes such signature must becompute_distance(vector1::Array{Float64, 1},\n                 vector2::Array{Float64, 1})::Float64If the value returned by compute_distance() is greater than or equal to minimum_distance, the algorithm will perform the path relink between the two chromosomes. Otherwise, it will look for another pair of chromosomes. The algorithm will try number_pairs chromosomes before gives up. In the presence of multiple populations, the path relinking is performed between elite chromosomes from different populations, in a circular fashion. For example, suppose we have 3 populations. The framework performs 3 path relinkings: the first between individuals from populations 1 and 2, the second between populations 2 and 3, and the third between populations 3 and 1. In the case of just one population, both base and guiding individuals are sampled from the elite set of that population.Note that in traditional path relink algorithms, compute_distance() depends on the problem structure. On IPR, you can use a generic distance function, or provide one that incorporates more knowledge about the problem. BrkgaMpIpr provides a function to compute the (modified) Hamming distance for threshold representations (hamming_distance), and a function that computes the Kendall Tau distance distance for permutation representations (kendall_tau_distance). Again, details about threshold and permutation representations in this paper.As a simple example, suppose you are using a threshold representation where each chromosome key can represent one of 3 different values (a ternary threshold representation). So, one possible way to compute the distance between two chromosomes can be:function value(key::Float64)::Float64\n    return key < 0.33 ? 0.0 : (key < 0.66 ? 1.0 : 2.0)\nend\n\nfunction compute_distance(vector1::Array{Float64, 1},\n                          vector2::Array{Float64, 1})::Float64\n    total = 0.0\n    for i in 1:length(vector1)\n        total += abs(value(vector1[i]) - value(vector2[i]))\n    end\n    return total\nendTo avoid changes that do not lead to new solutions, we must verify if such key exchanges affect the solution. For that, we must pass a function with the signature:affect_solution(block1::SubArray{Float64, 1},\n                block2::SubArray{Float64, 1})::Boolaffect_solution two gets partial chromosomes/block of genes block1 and block2 and checks whether changing the keys from block1 to block2 affects the solution. For instance, suppose that the alleles/keys are used as threshold such that values > 0.5 activate a feature. Suppose we have block1 = [0.3, 0.4, 0.1] and block2 = [0.4, 0.1, 0.2]. Since all values are below 0.5, changing the keys from block1 to block2 do not change the solution, and therefore, we can drop such change (and subsequently decoding). The blocks can hold only one key/allele, sequential key blocks, or even the whole chromosome. Note that affect_solution is crucial to the IPR performance since this function helps to avoid exploring regions already surveyed. Also, note that affect_solution can incorporate some problem knowledge.warning: Warning\nThe current implementation of permutation path relink does not make use of affect_solution. However, path_relink! requires the function. You can use the simple lambda function for this one:(x, y) -> trueblock_size defines the number of keys / size of the chromosome block to be exchanged during the direct path relink. This parameter is also critical for IPR performance since it avoids too many exchanges during the path building. Usually, we can compute this number based on the size of the chromosome by some factor (alpha_block_size in the configuration file), chosen by you. Again, details here.note: Note\nExperiments have shown that a good choice isblock_size = alpha_block_size times sqrtsizeofchromosomeThe last two parameters are stopping criteria. The algorithm stops either when max_time seconds is reached or percentage% of the path is built.warning: Warning\nIPR is a very time-intensive process. You must set the stopping criteria accordingly.Let\'s see the example on main_complete.jl. Remember, since we are solving the TSP, we want to use the permutation-based IPR, and the Kendall Tau distance functions.result = path_relink!(\n    brkga_data,\n    brkga_params.pr_type,\n    brkga_params.pr_selection,\n    kendall_tau_distance,\n    affect_solution_kendall_tau,\n    brkga_params.pr_number_pairs,\n    brkga_params.pr_minimum_distance,\n    1, #block_size doesn\'t not matter for permutation.\n    maximum_time - (time() - start_time),\n    brkga_params.pr_percentage\n)Note that most parameters come from BrkgaParams. The maximum IPR time is set to the remaining time for optimization (global maximum_time minus the elapsed time time() - start_time.path_relink! returns a PathRelinkingResult object which defines the status of the IPR optimization. These status are described on PathRelinkingResult.note: Note\nThe TOO_HOMOGENEOUS status is directly linked to the chosen distance function and minimum distance. If the minimum distance is too large, IPR may not be able to find a pair of chromosomes far enough for path relink.If the found solution is the best solution found so far, IPR replaces the worst solution by it. Otherwise, IPR computes the distance between the found solution and all other solutions in the elite set, and replaces the worst solution by it if and only if the found solution is, at least, minimum_distance from all them."

The reason is that if the decoder rewrites the chromosome, the path between solutions is lost and inadvertent results may come up. Note that at the end of the path relinking, the method calls the decoder with writeback = true in the best chromosome found to guarantee that this chromosome is re-written to reflect the best solution found.warning: Warning\nMake sure your decoder does not rewrite the chromosome when called with the argument writeback = false.BrkgaMpIpr path_relink! implementation is multi-threaded. Instead of to build and decode each chromosome one at a time, the method builds a list of candidates, altering the alleles/keys according to the guide solution, and then decode all candidates in parallel. Note that O(chromosome_size^2  block_size) additional memory is necessary to build the candidates, which can be costly if the chromosome_size is very large.warning: Warning\nAs it is in evolve!(), the decoding is done in parallel using threads, and the user must guarantee that the decoder is THREAD-SAFE.

When such a situation happens, it is a good idea to perturb the population, or even restart from a new one completely new.

This method offers two generic/implicit ShakingTypes. With CHANGE, direct modifications are done in the keys/alleles. This kind of shaking is recommended when the chromosome uses direct or threshold representations. SWAP exchanges keys/alleles inducing new permutations. For representational definitions, please read this paper. For instance, the following code shakes all populations using 10 swap moves.shake!(brkga_data, 10, SWAP)Sometimes, even shaking the populations does not help to escape from local maxima/minima. So, we need a drastic measure, restarting from scratch the role population. This can be easily accomplished with reset!.reset!(brkga_data)note: Note\nWhen using reset!, all warm-start solutions provided by set_initial_population! are discarded. You may use inject_chromosome! to insert those solutions again.warning: Warning\nAgain, the decoding of each chromosome is done in parallel if multi-thread is enabled. Therefore, we must guarantee that the decoder is THREAD-SAFE.

If you read the guide until here, you may notice that several methods take into account multiple populations. To use multiple populations, you must set BrkgaParams.num_independent_populations with 2 ou more populations, and build BrkgaData from such parameters.The immigration process is implemented byexchange_elite!(brkga_data::BrkgaData, num_immigrants::Int64)exchange_elite! copies num_immigrants from one population to another, replacing the worst num_immigrants individuals from the recipient population.

    "text": "Sometimes, it is a good idea to test how the standard BRKGA algorithm performs for a problem. You can use BrkgaMpIpr framework to quickly implement and test a standard BRKGA.First, you must guarantee that, during the crossover, the algorithm chooses only one elite individual and only one non-elite individual. This is easily accomplished setting num_elite_parents = 1 and total_parents = 2. Then, you must set up a bias function that ranks the elite and no-elite individual according to the original BRKGA bias parameter rho (rho).You can use set_bias_custom_function! for that task. The given function receives the index of the chromosome and returns a ranking for it. Such ranking is used in the roulette method to choose the individual from which each allele comes to build the new chromosome. Since we have one two individuals for crossover in the standard BRKGA, the bias function must return the probability to one or other individual. In the following code, we do that with a simple if...else lambda function.# create brkga_params by hand or reading from a file,\n# then set the following by hand.\nbrkga_params.num_elite_parents = 1\nbrkga_params.total_parents = 2\n\nrho = 0.75\nset_bias_custom_function!(brkga_data, x -> x == 1 ? rho : 1.0 - rho)\ninitialize!(brkga_data)Here, we first set the num_elite_parents = 1 and total_parents = 2 as explained before. Following, we set a variable rho = 0.75. This is the rho from standard BRKGA, and you may set it as you wish. Then, we set the bias function as a very simple lambda function:x -> x == 1 ? rho : 1.0 - rhoSo, if the index of the chromosome is 1 (elite individual), it gets a 0.75 rank/probability. If the index is 2 (non-elite individual), the chromosome gets 0.25 rank/probability.note: Note\nAll these operations must be done before calling initialize!."

The reason is that Julia uses lazy evaluation when live-compiling the code, i.e., it compiles as it goes. Another advantage is the memory location effects of our data (principle of locality), that can be brought closer to the processor (L2/L3 caches) during the running. Obliviously, this depends on how you implement and use your data structures.In main_complete.jl, we have the following piece of code to warmup mainly the decoder and other functions.

In general, the decoding is the most time-expensive component of a BRKGA algorithm, and it may skew some stopping criteria based on running time. Therefore, if your decoder is time-consuming, it is a good idea to implement a timer or chronometer kind of thing inside the decoder.Testing for stopping time uses several CPU cycles, and you need to be careful when/where to test it, otherwise, you spend all the optimization time doing system calls to the clock.IMHO, the most effective way to do it is to test time at the very end of the decoding. If the current time is larger than the maximum time allowed, simple return Inf or -Inf according to your optimization direction. In this way, we make the solution invalid since it violates the maximum time allowed. The BRKGA framework takes care of the rest."

    "text": "Since Moore\'s law is not holding its status anymore, we, simple mortals, must appeal to the wonders of multi-threading. This paradigm can be tricky to code, and Amdahl\'s law plays against us. Several genetic algorithms, and in particular, BRKGA, can use parallel solution evaluation (or decoding), which makes the use of multi-threading relatively straightforward. BrkgaMpIpr is not different, and it uses Julia multi-threading capabilities to do so.First, as commented several times in this guide, the decoder must be THREAD-SAFE. So, each thread must have its own read/write data structures and may share other read-only data. The simplest way to do it is to create those structures inside the decoder (like most people do). But be aware, this strategy slows down the algorithm significantly depending on the size and format of the structures, and I do not recommend it.IMHO, the best way to do that is to preallocate the data structure per thread (using Threads.nthreads()), and pass them to the decoder through the problem instance. Then, inside the decoder, you can use Threads.threadid() and recover the memory you want to use.Let\'s see a simple example considering the TSP example. tsp_decode! uses a single array to create the permutation of nodes. Let\'s pre-allocate its memory per thread. So, in TSP_Instance, we pre-allocate copies of such array, one for each thread:using Base.Threads\n\n# Declare as a type to make the code shorter and more readable.\nPermutationArray = Array{Tuple{Float64, Int64}, 1}\n\nstruct TSP_Instance <: AbstractInstance\n    num_nodes::Int64\n    distances::Array{Float64}\n\n    # Permutations arrays per thread, to be pre-allocated.\n    permutation_per_thread::Array{PermutationArray, 1}\n\n    function TSP_Instance(filename::String)\n        #... Code for loading here\n\n        # Allocate the main array to create references for other arrays per thread.\n        permutation_per_thread = Array{PermutationArray, 1}(undef, nthreads())\n\n        # Pre-allocate the permutation arrays, one for each thread.\n        for i in 1:nthreads()\n            permutation_per_thread[i] = PermutationArray(undef, num_nodes)\n        end\n\n        new(num_nodes, distances, permutation_per_thread)\n    end\nendThen, in tsp_decode!, we simply refer to the array according to the local thread ID:function tsp_decode!(chromosome::Array{Float64}, instance::TSP_Instance,\n                     rewrite::Bool = true)::Float64\n    permutation = instance.permutation_per_thread[threadid()]\n    #...\n    #...\nendNote that to pre-allocate decoding structures inside the object holding the instance is not the most elegant and decoupled code we can write. However, to decouple the decoding data from the instance data requires that we pass another data object to the decoder. To do this explicitly, we may get an embroidered API. We could do it implicitly, by creating a Singleton object to hold the decoding data. However, this also reduces (a lot) the clarity and objectivity of the code. In C++ code, this is much easier accomplished by creating a Decoder object that can hold data members as much as methods. Therefore, when creating the Decoder object, we can pre-allocate all data structures we need.note: Note\nPre-allocation and multi-threading only make sense for large data structures and time-consuming decoders. Otherwise, the code spends too much time on context switching and system calls."

For example, suppose we have 3 populations. The framework performs 3 path relinkings: the first between individuals from populations 1 and 2, the second between populations 2 and 3, and the third between populations 3 and 1. In the case of just one population, both base and guiding individuals are sampled from the elite set of that population.\n\nNote that the algorithm tries to find a pair of base and guiding solutions with a minimum distance given by the distance function. If this is not possible, a new pair of solutions are sampled (without replacement) and tested against the distance. In case it is not possible to find such pairs for the given populations, the algorithm skips to the next pair of populations (in a circular fashion, as described above). Yet, if such pairs are not found in any case, the algorithm declares failure. This indicates that the populations are very homogeneous.\n\nIf the found solution is the best solution found so far, IPR replaces the worst solution by it. Otherwise, IPR computes the distance between the found solution and all other solutions in the elite set, and replaces the worst solution by it if and only if the found solution is, at least, minimum_distance from all them.\n\nThe API will call decode!() function always with writeback = false. The reason is that if the decoder rewrites the chromosome, the path between solutions is lost and inadvertent results may come up. Note that at the end of the path relinking, the method calls the decoder with writeback = true in the best chromosome found to guarantee that this chromosome is re-written to reflect the best solution found.\n\nThis method is a multi-thread implementation. Instead of to build and decode each chromosome one at a time, the method builds a list of candidates, altering the alleles/keys according to the guide solution, and then decode all candidates in parallel. Note that O(chromosome_size^2 / block_size) additional memory is necessary to build the candidates, which can be costly if the chromosome_size is very large.\n\nwarning: Warning\nAs it is in evolve!(), the decoding is done in parallel using threads, and the user must guarantee that the decoder is THREAD-SAFE. If such property cannot be held, we suggest using single thread by setting the environmental variable JULIA_NUM_THREADS = 1 (see Julia Parallel Computing).\n\nArguments\n\nbrkga_data::BrkgaData: the BRKGA data.\npr_type::PathRelinkingType: type of path relinking to be performed.

Either BESTSOLUTION or RANDOMELITE.\ncompute_distance::Function: the function used to compute the distance between two chromosomes.

For instance, suppose that the alleles/keys are used as threshold such that values > 0.5 activate a feature. Suppose we have block1 = [0.3, 0.4, 0.1] and block2 = [0.4, 0.1, 0.2]. Since all values are below 0.5, changing the keys from block1 to block2 do not change the solution, and therefore, we can drop such change (and subsequentely decoding). The blocks can hold only one key/allele, sequential key blocks, or even the whole chromosome. affect_solution takes two views/subarrays. The function MUST HAVE the following signature\naffect_solution(block1::SubArray{Float64, 1},\n                block2::SubArray{Float64, 1})::Bool\nnote: Note\nThis function depends on the problem structure and how the   keys/alleles are used\nnumber_pairs::Int64: number of chromosome pairs to be tested.  If number_pairs < 1, all pairs are tested.\nminimum_distance::Float64: minimum distance between two chromosomes computed by compute_distance.\nblock_size::Int64 = 1: number of alleles to be exchanged at once in each iteration.
